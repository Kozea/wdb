Description
-----------

**wdb** is a complete web debugger for wsgi projects (implemented as a wsgi middleware).

Unlike other web debuggers, **wdb** is based on the [python bdb debugger framework](http://docs.python.org/2/library/bdb.html). (The one used by [pdb](http://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html))

This allows step by step debugging during the rendering of the page as well as exception inspection in the very state the exception occurred.

In other words it's an enhanced version of pdb directly in your browser with nice features.


How is it possible ?
--------------------

*WebSockets*! 
All debug information between web page and web server transits through a websocket opened on a random port.
Server request processing is blocked by the websocket and then resumed when the debugging is over.


Installation:
------------

```
    $ pip install wdb
```


Try it already
--------------

Now type:

```
    $ pip install flask
    $ python -m wdb.test
```

And open this <http://localhost:1984/> in your browser. It will stop at a division by zero error.

You can also go to <http://localhost:1984/wtf> and try step-by-step debugging right in your browser.


Usage
-----

To try it on another wsgi application, use the `Wdb` middleware:

```python
    from wdb import Wdb
    wsgi_app = Whathever_wsgi_server_lib()
    my_app = Wdb(wsgi_app)
    my_app.serve_forever()
```

### Using flask:

```python
    from flask import Flask
    from wdb import Wdb

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.debug = True
    app.wsgi_app = Wdb(app.wsgi_app)

    app.run(use_debugger=False) # Disable builtin Werkzeug debugger
```

or use the [Flask-Wdb](https://github.com/techniq/flask-wdb/) extension

```python
    from flask import Flask
    from flask_wdb import Wdb

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.debug = True
    Wdb(app)

    app.run()
```

### Using django:

In your `wsgi.py`, add the middleware:

After:

```python
    # This application object is used by any WSGI server configured to use this
    # file. This includes Django's development server, if the WSGI_APPLICATION
    # setting points here.
    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
    application = get_wsgi_application()
```

Add this:

```python
    from wdb import Wdb
    application = Wdb(application)
```

In your `settings.py`, activate exception propagation:

```python
    DEBUG = True
    DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS = True
```

### Breaking

You can now put some breakpoints in a request code:

```python
    do_something()
    import wdb; wdb.set_trace()
    return
```

Once you are in a breakpoint or in an exception, you can eval all you want in the prompt under the code.
Multi-lines are partially supported using `[Shift] + [Enter]`.

As of now the following special commands are supported during breakpoint:

   * `.s or [Ctrl] + [↓] or [F11]  `: Step into
   * `.n or [Ctrl] + [→] or [F10]  `: Step over (Next)
   * `.r or [Ctrl] + [↑] or [F9]   `: Step out (Return)
   * `.c or [Ctrl] + [←] or [F8]   `: Continue
   * `.u or [F7]                   `: Until (Next over loops)
   * `.j lineno                    `: Jump to lineno (Must be at bottom frame and in the same function)
   * `.b [file:]lineno[, condition]`: Break on file at lineno (file is the current file by default)
   * `.t [file:]lineno[, condition]`: Same as b but break only once
   * `.f                           `: Echo all typed commands in the current debugging session
   * `.d expression                `: Dump the result of expression in a table
   * `.q                           `: Quit
   * `.h                           `: Get some help
   * `expr !> file                 `: Write the result of expr in file
   * `!< file                      `: Eval the content of file
   * `[Enter]                      `: Eval the current selected text in page, useful to eval code in the source
   * `[Ctrl] + [r]                 `: Search back in command history
   * `[Ctrl] + [Shift] + [r]       `: Search forward in command history

You can also eval a variable in the source by middle clicking on it.
You can add/remove a breakpoint by clicking on the line number.

NB: Hotkeys with arrows are purposely not triggered in the eval prompt to avoid conflicts when typing.


It is sloooow
-------------

If wdb slows down too much of your application (tracing all the things takes time), you can start it disabled with:

```python
    my_app = Wdb(wsgi_app, start_disabled=True)
```

Now when you encounter an exception or a set_trace, a page will appear asking you if you want to reload the page with wdb enabled.

Manual activation/deactivation can be done anytime with:

* <http://yourserver/__wdb/on>
* <http://yourserver/__wdb/off>


Where's the white theme ?
-------------------------

Here:
```python
    my_app = Wdb(wsgi_app, theme='light')
```

But it is less polished than the dark theme.
If you like writing css feel free to make your own and pull request it to me.


Code completion works ?
-----------------------

Yay ! It is based on [jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi).


Contribute
----------

I know it is not very well documented and all but contributions are more than welcomed, use the fork luke !
